# one performance can produce many digital signals

# one permance can have more than performer and each performer can perform several performances (what a delightfully articulate description! Someone buy me a thesaurus...)
# only one conductor p er perfromance (although doesn't necessarily have to be so??) 
# each performance is of only one musical work, but the musical works can be of the granularity of acts i.e. doesn't have to be the whole opera. In the future this could even be greater granularity.
